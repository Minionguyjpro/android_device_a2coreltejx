# TWRP Device Tree for Samsung Galaxy A2 Core
This is the device tree for the Samsung Galaxy A2 Core (confirmed to work in normal circumstances on the SM-A260F, untested on the SM-A260G. Feel free to do so and let me know!) for use Sith TWRP. Includes a prebuilt kernel recompiled by me to allow LZMA ramdisk compression.
